### Turbopack is intentionally disabled

`dev`/`build` pass `--webpack` explicitly. **Do not remove that flag or "helpfully" switch back to the Next.js 16 default (Turbopack).** Turbopack's bundled Lightning CSS silently drops the standard `backdrop-filter` declaration in favor of `-webkit-backdrop-filter` alone whenever both are present, and current Chromium no longer honors that prefix — the entire glassmorphism design (present on nearly every surface) renders with zero blur under Turbopack. webpack's PostCSS/Tailwind pipeline autoprefixes correctly (adds, never replaces). If a task requires Turbopack for some other reason, budget time to re-verify `backdrop-filter` across the site before shipping.

## Architecture

This is a Next.js 16.2.10 App Router site for "arcfine" (an AI/software agency; the brand is always lowercase, and it was called Nexora until V17.81 — that's where the `nxr-` class prefix comes from), built with React 19 and TypeScript. Two pages are built — the homepage (`/`) and `/desarrollo-web` — plus the `app/api/contacto` Route Handler. Per `AGENTS.md`, this Next.js version has breaking changes vs. training data — check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before relying on remembered APIs.

The visual design (glassmorphism cards, video wall, scroll-driven 3D effects) was originally ported from a WordPress "Code Snippets" PHP site, which is why every custom class is prefixed `nxr-` and `app/globals.css` is organized into numbered sections (`/* ===== Hero ===== */`, etc.) mirroring the original snippet blocks.

### Styling: one global stylesheet, not CSS Modules

All custom CSS lives in `app/globals.css` (~6000 lines), imported once in `app/layout.tsx`. Tailwind is imported (`@import "tailwindcss";`) but is not used for the actual design — components use hand-written classes and CSS custom properties instead. Design tokens (`--c-red`, `--c-lime`, `--c-salmon`, `--glass-bg`, `--glass-border-gradient`, `--radius-md`/`--radius-lg`, `--font`, etc.) are defined once in `:root`. The shared glass utilities (`.nxr-glass`, `.nxr-glass-edge` + `.nxr-glass-edge-content`, gradient-border-via-mask) are still used for nav, buttons and smaller chrome — but the *large* card/panel surfaces are no longer CSS glass at all: they are WebGL meshes docked behind transparent DOM anchors (see "The global 3D scene" below).

When adding a new component, add its styles to `globals.css` in a clearly-commented section rather than introducing a CSS Module, to keep the single-stylesheet convention consistent.

### The global 3D scene: one R3F canvas behind every route

The old imperative Three.js backgrounds (`ThreeBackground`/`WaveBackground`) were replaced by a unified React Three Fiber scene. `app/layout.tsx` mounts `SceneCanvasLazy`, which dynamic-imports (`ssr: false`) and idle-mounts `components/scene/SceneCanvas.tsx`: a single page-wide `<Canvas>` (fixed, `100lvh`, `z-index: -1000`, `pointer-events: none`) shared by all routes. **Never statically import `SceneCanvas`** — the ~700KB WebGL stack must stay off the load's critical path (statically imported, its parse/eval + shader compilation dominated TBT).

Load-bearing invariant: `PixelCamera` recomputes the FOV on resize so **1 three.js world unit == 1 CSS pixel at z=0** (`CAMERA_DISTANCE = 1000`). Every layer positions meshes directly from `getBoundingClientRect()` numbers — no unit conversion anywhere.

Inside the canvas:

- **Section poses (V17.95)**: the wall re-aims itself as you scroll from section to section, on the same axes as the existing cursor parallax (`group.rotation.y/x` + the shader's `uFocus`), damped at 0.045 (~1s). **It is the wall that moves, never the camera** — `PixelCamera`'s 1-unit-per-CSS-pixel invariant is what every DOM-anchored mesh depends on, so moving the camera would slide the service cards, the ZoomParallax cards and the glass panels off the HTML they are pinned to. The target pose comes from the section's **index in document order** through the golden angle (2.39996 rad), so consecutive sections never land near each other and no per-section table needs maintaining; index 0 stays dead centre (that's the hero). A second IntersectionObserver in `SceneCanvas` (`rootMargin: "-45% 0px -45% 0px"`, a 10% band at mid-screen) writes `poseSeccion.indice` in `store/sceneActivity.ts`; it observes **every `section[id]`**, so new pages join automatically — unlike the `alwaysIds` list above, forgetting a section here costs nothing. Disabled under reduced motion.
- `SceneBackground` — the concave "TV wall": custom shader on an arc geometry playing `public/bg-video.mp4` / `bg-video-vertical.mp4` (preloaded per orientation via `<link rel="preload">` in the layout, picked at runtime by live portrait tracking). Invalidates renders via `requestVideoFrameCallback` (~25–30fps page-wide), with a keep-alive that only runs while the video is stalled so a frozen video can never freeze demand-mode rendering.
- `VolumetricCard` — the reusable glass slab: procedural rounded-rect geometry with a real convex dome (concentric-ring tessellation, deliberately not `ExtrudeGeometry`) or a cylindrical `bend` — mutually exclusive; combining them draws an "X" artifact. Uses drei's `MeshTransmissionMaterial` in `transmissionSampler` mode so **all cards share one downscaled transmission capture** (`gl.transmissionResolutionScale = 0.35`, set in SceneCanvas `onCreated`) instead of per-card FBOs; the low resolution doubles as the frosted-blur look. Geometry is `useMemo`'d — built once, zero per-frame cost.
- Three layers that dock meshes behind DOM anchors: `GlassPanelsLayer` (generic flat panels: Intro, Proceso, Tech's stat strip, Contacto, the Hero CTA, ProcesoReel, CapacidadesWeb, the AgentesIa sections), `ServiciosCardsLayer` (the 5 bent service cards) and `ZoomParallaxCardsLayer` (the 7 zoom cards, see below).
- The frameloop has 3 regimes: `never` (tab hidden), `always` (only when a card section is near AND the user recently scrolled/interacted, 450ms decay), `demand` otherwise. `EffectComposer` (Bloom + Vignette) is desktop-only; `dpr` is 1.25 desktop / 1 mobile; `antialias: false` because the composer brings its own MSAA buffers. Bloom runs at `resolutionScale={0.5}` — it owns the only multi-pass chain in the composer (Vignette merges into the final EffectPass), so its cost scales with the buffer it starts from.
- The wall's fragment shader skips its whole "screen off" half (per-cell detail, twinkle, sheen, stuck subpixels, grain) and the video pipeline behind **uniform** `if`s on `uPower`. Those branches only pay off because the power ramp in `useFrame` **snaps to its target**: an asymptotic lerp would sit at ~0.998 forever and never take them. If you touch that ramp, keep the snap.

#### DOM ↔ WebGL bridge: zustand registries in `store/`

The canvas lives in a different React tree than the pages, so DOM sections register their anchor elements into registries — `useGlassPanelsRegistry` (written via `hooks/useGlassPanels.ts`), `useServiciosCardsRegistry`, `useZoomParallaxCardsRegistry` — in a `useEffect` with cleanup; the scene layers read those anchors and call `getBoundingClientRect()` inside their own `useFrame`, same frame. The visible DOM cards (`.nxr-srv-card`, `.nxr-zp-card`) are **transparent content shells** — no CSS background/blur/border; the mesh provides the glass body.

Rules that keep this fast (each one earned by a real bug):

- Inside `useFrame`, read stores via `.getState()`, never the reactive hook; per-frame data (e.g. Servicios' `setTransform`, written every GSAP tick) is an in-place mutation, not a zustand `set`, to avoid per-frame re-renders/GC churn.
- **Never `setState` from inside `useFrame`** — a version that did was silently dropped by React. Dimension changes flow ResizeObserver → registry `set` → geometry rebuild, tolerance-gated (rebuilding geometry every frame is catastrophic).
- Every layer's `useFrame` starts with a `nearSections.has(sectionId)` early-out (below), so off-screen sections cost nothing while the TV wall keeps invalidating page-wide.

#### `nearSections` — the coupling list (replaces the old `SEC_IDS`)

`store/sceneActivity.ts` exports a plain mutable `Set<string>` (deliberately NOT zustand — it's read at the top of every `useFrame`, so it must be a zero-cost `.has()`). A single IntersectionObserver in `SceneCanvas.tsx` (rootMargin 300px) adds/removes section ids. The observed ids are hardcoded there (`alwaysIds` + `"nxr-hero"`): `nxr-servicios`, `nxr-zoom-parallax`, `nxr-intro`, `nxr-proceso`, `nxr-tech`, `nxr-contacto`, `nxr-dwh-proceso`, `nxr-dwh-capacidades`, `nxr-aia-hero`, `nxr-aia-casos`, `nxr-aia-noche`, `nxr-aia-pasos`, `nxr-hero`. **Any new section containing tracked glass/cards must add its `<section id>` to that list, or its meshes stay invisible forever.** Unlike the old `SEC_IDS`, the list is order-independent and route-agnostic (ids missing from the current page are filtered out at observe time). Two layers additionally hardcode their own section id (`"nxr-servicios"` in ServiciosCardsLayer, `"nxr-zoom-parallax"` in ZoomParallaxCardsLayer) — renaming those sections breaks the gate silently.

Other counts that must stay in sync: ZoomParallax = 7 cards across `ZoomParallax.tsx` (`CARDS`), `useZoomParallaxCardsRegistry`, `ZoomParallaxCardsLayer` (`ZP_STYLES`) and the `.nxr-zp-layer:nth-child(N)` `--zp-max` rules in `globals.css`; Servicios = 5 cards across `Servicios.tsx`, `useServiciosCardsRegistry` and `ServiciosCardsLayer`.

### Page assembly

`app/page.tsx` composes the homepage as `Hero, Intro, Servicios, ZoomParallax, Proceso, Tech, Contacto`; `app/desarrollo-web/page.tsx` is `DesarrolloWebHero, ProcesoReel, CapacidadesWeb, DwhTechStack, Contacto`. `Header` is mounted once in `app/layout.tsx`, not per page.

**`ProcesoReel` is no longer a reel** (V17.98) — the name is kept only so the page's import doesn't move. It was a pinned horizontal scroll (sticky + `width: max-content` track scrubbed in x + depth carousel + progress dots); it is now a plain centred flex grid of five cards, no pin and no scrub, with a one-shot staggered entrance. That makes `Servicios` the **only** horizontal-scroll pin left on the site.

It is also the one section that **deliberately opts out of the WebGL glass** (V17.99, it was lagging). Its cards were `useGlassPanels` anchors, and a visible `MeshTransmissionMaterial` forces the scene to capture everything behind it once per frame — real money on a page already carrying the fullscreen video wall, and it bought nothing for five static text cards. They now use an opaque background plus `.nxr-glass-edge` (mask gradient border, no blur, no compositing layer). **Do not "restore" the glass with `backdrop-filter`**: with the canvas repainting page-wide at ~30fps the compositor redoes every blur layer each time, so five of them cost more than the mesh that was removed (same reasoning that caps `GradualBlur` at 2 divs). Because it has no tracked meshes left, `nxr-dwh-proceso` was also dropped from `alwaysIds` — leaving it there pinned the frameloop at 60fps with nothing to draw.

Service detail pages live at top-level routes matching `Header.tsx`'s `SERVICIOS` array (`/desarrollo-web`, `/agentes-ia`, `/automatizaciones`, `/seo`, `/apps-software`), not under `/servicios/*`. Four of the five are built; **`/apps-software` still 404s**, as do `/servicios`, `/nosotros` and `/casos` — all four are linked from the header menu anyway, which is a known outstanding bug. `/contacto` and `/precios` do exist as standalone pages, and the `Contacto` section is also embedded at the bottom of every service page.

### Per-page 3D: self-contained canvases for hero scenes

Besides the global scene, a page can mount its own `<Canvas>` for a hero. `/desarrollo-web` layers `components/dwh/HeroScene.tsx` (a drifting code-glyph field with its own IntersectionObserver gating its `frameloop`, dynamic-imported `ssr: false`) *behind* a crisp DOM browser mockup (`components/dwh/BrowserBuild.tsx`) that a GSAP `ScrollTrigger` timeline in `DesarrolloWebHero.tsx` builds stage by stage. The GSAP-vs-Canvas split rules for new pages live in `AGENTS.md` (ScrollTrigger + `pin` must live in the normal DOM tree, never inside `<Canvas>`).

### Global fixed-position layers (mounted once, in `app/layout.tsx`)

- `SmoothScroll` — owns the single Lenis instance, exposed as `window.__nxrLenis`; **any programmatic scrolling must go through it** (see `Servicios.tsx`). Also calls `ScrollTrigger.config({ ignoreMobileResize: true })`. **`syncTouch` is deliberately OFF** (V18.67): with it on, Lenis takes the touch gesture and scrolls programmatically, and mobile browsers never collapse their toolbar for a programmatic scroll — so touch scrolling is now the browser's own. Two things went with it: the glass meshes (positioned per frame from DOM rects) can trail a frame behind during a fast mobile scroll, and the touch flick cap is gone for good — it worked by clamping Lenis' `targetScroll` on `touchend`, and native momentum has no target to clamp. Desktop is unaffected; `syncTouch` only governs touch.
- `ScrollProgress` — red right-edge progress bar replacing the native scrollbar; rAF-coalesced, mutates only `transform: scaleY`.
- `ScrollSnap` — settles the scroll onto the nearest `section[id]` boundary when it stops **within 35% of the viewport** of one. Deliberately proximity-based, not slide-style snapping: most sections here are not one screen (the hero pins for 3.6 screens, Intro 2.4, the Servicios reel more), so mandatory snapping to section starts would skip those scrubbed runs entirely — mid-run no boundary is near and it stays out of the way. The glide is an **own rAF loop writing absolute positions through `lenis.scrollTo(..., immediate)`**; both obvious alternatives were verified to fail with Lenis in the loop (ScrollTrigger's native `snap` writes raw scroll that Lenis re-emits and ScrollTrigger reads back as user input, killing its own tween; a duration-based `lenis.scrollTo()` loses the tug-of-war with Lenis' internal lerp). Any wheel/touch/key cancels the glide. Disabled under reduced motion.
- `SceneCanvasLazy` — the global WebGL backdrop (see above).
- `RevealInit` — a single page-wide `IntersectionObserver` that adds `.nxr-visible` to any `.nxr-reveal` element for fade-in-on-scroll; sections just add the `nxr-reveal` class rather than wiring up their own observer.
- `GradualBlur` ×2 — progressive backdrop-filter bands at top/bottom (`divCount={2}` on purpose: each div is a full-width blur pass the compositor re-runs on every canvas frame, so keep the count low; `strength` is calibrated against it — the outermost band blurs `0.0625·(divCount+1)·strength` rem, so changing one without the other changes the look), sitting above content but below the Header/floating nav (z-index 9998/9999). The component was pruned to these three props in V17.76 — it no longer accepts presets, responsive heights, hover intensity or `target`.

### Scroll rhythm lives in one place

`lib/scrollRitmo.ts` owns **the single mobile breakpoint for scroll** (`MOVIL_MAX = 900`, via `esMovil()`) and the **per-section pin distance table** (`RECORRIDO` + `recorridoPin(...)`). Before V18.26 each pinned component wrote its own `end: () => (window.innerWidth < 768 ? "+=X%" : "+=Y%")`, and **two different breakpoints coexisted** — some sections flipped to mobile at 768px and others at 900px, so between those widths (a portrait tablet) the page ran half in phone mode and half in desktop mode. Ten components now read from the module; there is no loose `900` left in `components/`.

Deliberately **not** centralised, and the module says so: section heights in `vh` for non-pinned sections (they live in `globals.css` with their media query), the per-section split between "hold" and "transition" (`PROLOGUE`/`HOLD_FRASE` in Servicios, `SLOW_K`/`SPREAD` in Intro — not interchangeable between sections), Lenis' base feel in `SmoothScroll.tsx`, and the `< 768` checks that are about layout or GPU quality rather than gesture (notably `SceneCanvas`'s `isMobile`, which gates `dpr` and cloud density and *should* be independent).

There's no shared "scroll context": components register their own native `scroll`/`resize` listeners independently. This works because Lenis drives the *real* browser scroll position (not a virtual one), so plain `window.scrollY` / native `scroll` events stay valid everywhere.

### Mobile viewport stability

Mobile browsers fire `resize` (and change `window.innerHeight`) when the address-bar toolbar shows/hides during scroll. Current guards:

- `SmoothScroll` sets `ScrollTrigger.config({ ignoreMobileResize: true })` — pin/scrub distances don't recompute on toolbar resizes.
- The scene container uses `100lvh` (large viewport units), so the canvas box never resizes.
- `Hero.tsx` maintains a `--vh-100` CSS variable from `window.innerHeight` (updated live on resize — safe precisely *because* ScrollTrigger ignores those resizes), consumed by `#nxr-zoom-sticky` and the hero stage. `DesarrolloWebHero.tsx` maintains a mobile-only `--dwh-vh` equivalent because Safari and Chrome disagree about `100lvh` there.

For new components, prefer `100lvh`/these variables over `100dvh`/`100svh` or raw `innerHeight` reads in animation math.

### `ZoomParallax.tsx` — CSS `transform: scale()` drives; WebGL renders the glass

Still the most engineered piece on the page. Each of the 7 cards is laid out in CSS (`globals.css`, per `nth-child`) at its largest "start-of-scroll" size; on scroll, JS updates only `transform: scale(k)` on the anchor — never `width`/`height`/`left`/`top` — because a pure transform is GPU-composited with no reflow (measured ~7x cheaper than real layout per frame) and shrinking a transform never pixelates. `ZoomParallaxCardsLayer` mirrors this per frame: it reads each anchor's *scaled* rect and applies the size as a **group scale** on a mesh whose geometry was built once (`BASE_H = 400`) — never rebuilt per frame.

Because the whole anchor (text, padding) is scaled down by one transform, every fixed-pixel value inside must be pre-multiplied by that card's `--zp-max` custom property (e.g. `font-size: calc(18px * var(--zp-max, 1));`) so it cancels out at rest. **Any new fixed-pixel value under `.nxr-zp-*` needs the same `calc(X * var(--zp-max, 1))` treatment**, and each card's `data-max-scale` in the TSX must match its `--zp-max` in CSS. The glass itself (background, blur, border, shadow) is the mesh's job now — don't add CSS glass back onto `.nxr-zp-card`.

The center card (index 0) additionally carries a `data-max-scale-mobile` attribute distinct from `data-max-scale`, because mobile needs a lower zoom intensity than desktop to avoid the card overflowing the viewport at the start of the scroll — the component picks whichever attribute applies based on `window.innerWidth`.

### Shared hooks & reduced motion

`hooks/useReducedMotion.ts` reads `prefers-reduced-motion` via `useSyncExternalStore` (SSR snapshot returns `false`, so the animated branch renders first and flips after mount — no hydration mismatch, no `RevealInit` race). The established pattern: each animated section returns a separate static JSX branch when `reducedMotion` is true, and every `useGSAP`/effect early-returns on it. **Anchor-registration effects must list `reducedMotion` in their deps** (see the `useGlassPanels` call sites and `Servicios.tsx`) so meshes re-register against whichever branch is actually mounted — the scene layers are not reduced-motion-aware themselves, and a mesh pointing at an unmounted branch stays hidden forever. Never delay real markup behind a `ready`-style state: `RevealInit`'s observer only scans the DOM once, on its own mount.

Other shared hooks: `useGlassPanels` (register a DOM element as a glass-panel mesh), `useCurvedWords`, `useDampedSticky`, `useScrollBrake`, `useTitleReveal`.

### Contact form → Route Handler → Resend

`components/Contacto.tsx` is a multi-step client-side form that POSTs to `app/api/contacto/route.ts`, which sends the notification email via Resend. Requires `RESEND_API_KEY` and `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` (see `.env.example`); without them the route responds with an error rather than silently succeeding.
